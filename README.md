## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
Hello from Japan!ã€€I am Kizuku from Shiga University and pursuing my MS in Data Science, with one more year to completion.
I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics at Lakeland University, and took a step on the Graduate school to experience carrying out research!

In my first year of MS, I explored the sea of interests and decided to focus on silence in speech.
Currently, I have planned to perform an RCT experiment and build an LLM model to discover the contextual connection of the effect of silence on the Japanese language.

Regarding my tech path, I learned programming in C++, Python, and a little bit of Java, and created a bingo game, android app., Web pages, and so forth in my Bachelor's program.
